- How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
  - I can ensure that my code, program, and software is functional and secure by using a combination of unit testing and code review. 
  
- How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
  - I would interpret user needs by asking specific questions to determine what they want the program to do. To incorporate them into the program, I would write code that I believe matches the needs and use unit testing to confirm each part of the code is producing the desired results.  
  
- How do I approach designing software?
  - I approach designing software by first trying to understand the problem that the software is trying to solve. I would then identify the intended users of the software and what their needs are. From there, I would develop a design chart that would outline the system. Afterwards, I would break the software into smaller and more manageable parts to make creating the software easier. I would then consider what language I would want to use to create the software and then start making a prototype. Throughout this process, I would be updating a design document that would be used as a reference for future development.
